# PHX_project_A2_Navigation_Feature_Branch
###### project for EC601
#### Introduction
We are using a combination of two navigation options provided by React Native Navigation - stack navigation and tab navigation.
In this feature we demonstrate the function that enables navigation between different screens inside the app.
###### Also, you can check our draft UI in this part.

#### Initialization
1. Have an initialized ReactNative project, please follow the installation guide [here](https://github.com/Zoe3542188/PHX_project_A2/tree/master#installation)
2. Install [react-native-navigation v2](https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation) 
(This step is a little bit tricky, please follow a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osMg869VwFY) if you need)
3. Install react-native-elements and icons with npm install:
- `npm i react-native-elements --save`
- `npm i react-native-vector-icons --save`
- you also need to add vector-icon package into your library, please follow [these steps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-vector-icons#ios)

#### Utilization
1. add the whole [screen folder](https://github.com/Zoe3542188/PHX_project_A2/tree/Feature_Navigation/screen) under your main project folder
2. Replace [index.js](https://github.com/Zoe3542188/PHX_project_A2/blob/Feature_Navigation/index.js)
3. Run your app (first type `react-native start` in a bash terminal and then run `react-native run-ios` in a separate window)
